I chose to develop Tic Tac Toe to test my skills in the C programming language. As my first project i choose portuguese as main language.The timelessness of this game was one of the main reasons for my choice. Despite its simple and intuitive mechanics, I aim to enhance it further by adding features like the option to play against the computer. I hope to complete this project in the near future.
